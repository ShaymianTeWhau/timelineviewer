# Timeline Viewer

A JavaScript-based timeline visualization tool that displays time-based events across swimlanes, scalable from millennia to seconds.

### Features
- Render timelines with precise date labels
- Smooth zooming between time scales (millennium → second)
- Swimlane-based organization of time periods
- Mouse interaction for hovering and selecting time periods
- Lightweight, canvas-based rendering

#### Note:
There is currently no backend — the app must be served using a local or live server due to fetch() being used to load timeline.json.

The included timeline.json is a sample dataset.
